# in OOP, a class is a structure that allows you to group together a set of properties (called attributes) and functions called methods to manipulate those properties.
# most classes will need the constructor method (__init__) to initialize the class's attributes.

# class Person:

#   def __init__(self, name, age): # class constructor
#     self.name = name #class variable
#     self.age = age #class variable
  
#   def greet(self):
#     print("Hello, my name is %s!" % self.name)
    
# a = Person("Peter", 20) # instantiation
# b = Person("Anna", 19) # instantiation

# a.greet() # call a's greet method
# b.greet() # call b's greet method

# print(a.name)
# print(a.age)  # We can also access the attributes of an object

# print(b.name)
# print(b.age)  # We can also access the attributes of an object
